# Perceptora Core

**Perceptora Core** is the foundational repository of the Perceptora project, an open-source research initiative focused on building time-aware, perceptual AI systems that evolve conceptual understanding across experience.

This repository contains early-stage modules and documentation for the following architectural layers:

- **Latent Temporal Embedding (LTe)**: Time-contextualized perceptual encoding
- **Perceptual Recurrent Loop (PRL)**: Feedback-driven perception refinement
- **Active World Model (AWM)**: Internal simulation of environment dynamics
- **Dynamic Concept Lattice (DCL)**: Temporal and relational evolution of meaning

## 🔬 Vision

We envision intelligent systems that do not merely react to the present,
but perceive across time — remembering, anticipating, and evolving meaning.

Perceptora aims to lay the groundwork for time-aware, self-adjusting AI
that can form internal worlds, recognize shifting patterns, and reason through conceptual change.
